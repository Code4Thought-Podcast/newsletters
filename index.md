## 1 Feb 2023, FOSDEM 
Not being a fan of acronyms, let's begin by explaining what [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2023/) actually stands for. Acc to the conference website, the origin go back to the year 2000, when Raphael Bauduin create the Open Source Developers' European Meeting (OSDEM). In the second year, it was renamed to FOSDEM - and I am taking a wild guess here when I assume the F to stand for Free. So, there you have it. 

So, FOSDEM will be running for two days, 4 and 5 Feb 2023, in Brussels at Universit√© Libre. Brussels being within easy reach from London on the Eurostar, I'll be heading off this coming Saturday to see for myself. It promises to be an interesting event with tons of developer and plenary sessions, in person as well as hybrid. Looking forward to it. 


## 29 Jan 2023, What's Coming this Year?
The good news is that I there are a number of episodes ready for publishing until summer this year. But, as we go into year 3 of Code for Thought, I'd like to expand the podcast:
- Conference reporting: In person events are happening again and the plan is to start covering conferences and workshops, starting with [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2023/) in Brussels 4 and 5 Feb, followed by the German RSE [conference](https://de-rse23.sciencesconf.org) in Paderborn 20-22 Feb and [JupyterCon](https://www.jupytercon.com) in Paris 10-12 May.
- Going International: Watch out for the interview with the founders of [RSE Asia](https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/) which will go live in the first half of this year. But I am also excited about the idea of launching a **German** language version of Code for Thought - starting with the RSE conference in Paderborn (see above)
- ByteSized RSE: Our ByteSized RSE mini series is to continue with 4 more episodes. The series has been in conjunction with the online and interactive sessions run by Jeremy Cohen and Steve Couch. It's an exciting idea to combine training sessions with podcast episodes. And we will discuss how we can take this further in future. 

## 28 Jan 2023, Starting a Newsletter and Support on Patreon
Over the past two years I found there is a lot of information and material that may not make it into an episode. Which doesn't mean it's not worthwhile sharing. 
Hence, I would like to use this space to give you extra bits of stories, information, news snippets etc. 

In addition, I would like to ask you for your support.
The podcast has been growing since its creation some 56 episodes ago. 
It has been an amazing journey. And one I would like to continue with more content for listeners and readers.
And so for 2023 and beyond, I plan to spend more time and effort on content creation and production.

Since this is a community podcast I really appreciate your feedback and ideas.
There are plenty of ways to contact me 
- on Slack ukrse  (@piddie), 
- Mastodon (@code4thought@fosstodon.org), 
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pweschmidt/) or 
- simply by (email)[mailto:code4thought@proton.me].

I also took the liberty to create a "tipping" jar for the podcast on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/codeforthought).
