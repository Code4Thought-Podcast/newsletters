# News and Blogs

## 28 Jan 2023, Starting a Newsletter and Support on Patreon
Over the past two years I found there is a lot of information and material that may not make it into an episode. Which doesn't mean it's not worthwhile sharing. 
Hence, I would like to use this space to give you extra bits of stories, information, news snippets etc. 

In addition, I would like to ask you for your support.
The podcast has been growing since its creation some 56 episodes ago. 
It has been an amazing journey. And one I would like to continue with more content for listeners and readers.
And so for 2023 and beyond, I plan to spend more time and effort on content creation and production.

Since this is a community podcast I really appreciate your feedback and ideas.
There are plenty of ways to contact me 
- on Slack ukrse  (@piddie), 
- Mastodon (@code4thought@fosstodon.org), 
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pweschmidt/) or 
- simply by (email)[mailto:code4thought@proton.me].

I also took the liberty to create a "tipping" jar for the podcast on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/codeforthought).
